# COOKING RECEIPE
## Ingredients
* 3 cups of cold water
* 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, divided
* 1 cup (about 5 ounces) fresh sliced strawberries
* 1 cup lemon juice (from 4 to 6 lemons, depending on size and juicer efficiency)

## Necessary Tools
* Juicer or blender

## Receipe
1. Combine water and 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a 1-liter carafe
2. Shake the carafe several times and set it aside in the fridge to chill out
3. Combine your berry of choice with remaining tablespoon of sugar
4. Let the berries sit withthe surgar for 10 minutes
5. Blend the strawberries and sugar until fully pureed, then for another minute
6. Press through a fine-mesh strainer if prefer leamonade without seeds.
7. Remove sugarwater carafe from the fridge and slightly shake it
8. Add 4 tablespoons of the strawberry puree
9. Shake the carafe well
10. Drink it right away or chill till using it

## Best Season
* Ingredients are available all year long. Although it would be nice to have a chill drink in the hot Summer days.

## Variations
* Raspberries and blackberries can be used for different flavors. Follow the directions for making the strawberry puree

# Euclidean Distance
Definition: The **Eucledean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\bar{pq}$.

In Cartesian coordinates, if p = ($p_1, p_2,...,p_n$) and q = ($q_1, q_2,...,q_n$) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

d( **p**, **q**) = d( **q**, **p**) = $\sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 +...+ (q_n - p_n)^2}$

=$\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(q_i-p_i)^2}$

The positions of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean distance**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$\|\textbf{p}\|$ = $\sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 +...+ p_n^2}$ = $\sqrt{ \textbf{p}\cdot \textbf{p} }$,

where the last expression involves the dot product.
